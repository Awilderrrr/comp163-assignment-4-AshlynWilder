# comp163-assignment-4-AshlynWilder

My game simulates the life of a college student balancing academics, social life, and stress. The player name is Ashlyn Wilder and she takes on the role of a series of decisions (course load, study strategy, and final semester activity). The player shapes their character’s academic performance and overall well-being. 

I use if and elif/if in my final choice variable to let the player decide what outcome they want. I used this at the end of my program.

How to run the game is the player would first have to Choose your course load (A, B, C), then Pick a study focus (Programming, Math, English, History), finally they would Make a final semester decision (1/2/3).

Hackathon (Choice 1) represents prioritizing academics, projects, and skill growth. Ends with stronger academic standing. Social Event (Choice 2) represents prioritizing networking, friendships, and fun. Ends with higher social points but maybe at GPA cost. Reset Week (Choice 3) represents self-care and balance. Ends with lower stress and a reset for the next term. Invalid Choice demonstrates what happens when the user doesn’t pick an option.

I used AI to help brainstorm ideas for the game. AI also helped debug some of the problems I had in my code.
